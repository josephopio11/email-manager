            Normal Human software through a single purchase, granting users
            unrestricted and perpetual access to its comprehensive
            functionalities. Tailored for independent creators, entrepreneurs,

            compelling web pages and online portfolios. This license entails a
            straightforward and flexible arrangement, exempting users from
            recurring fees or subscriptions. However, it is important to
            acknowledge that the licensor retains the right to terminate the
            license without conditions or prerequisites. This termination
            provision enables the licensor to exercise control over software
            distribution and utilization. Opting for the Normal Human Software
            License enables users to enjoy the benefits of the software while
            recognizing the licensor's unrestricted termination rights, which
            provide adaptability and address potential unforeseen circumstances.
